## Hi there, I'm Matt ðŸ‘‹

Hey there! I'm Matt. I'm a computer science graduate with a master's degree from Ontario Tech University (formerly known as University of Ontario Institute of Technology). I'm passionate in creating applications that are interesting, practical and innovative. My biggest achievement is my master's thesis (Midair Handwriting in Virtual Reality) where I created a project that is three-fold. First was developing a data-gathering application using Unity and C\# where participants could write in midair while the application gathered data. Second was performing the data-gathering experiment. The third was performing data preprocessing (data cleaning, transformation, feature engineering) on the collected data to train and test several machine learning models. 

After graduating, I picked up full-stack development and DevOps. My projects include my [Electric Guitar Finder Website](https://github.com/kermattc/electric-guitar-backend) and my [Portfolio Website](https://github.com/kermattc/portfolio-site).

Outside of coding, I like to play guitar (at the time of writing this, I'm starting a band!), play baseball and mod keyboards. I also like staying physically active, so I hit the gym regularly and stick to a solid meal plan.
