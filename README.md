## Hi there, I'm Matt ðŸ‘‹

Hey there! I'm Matt. I'm a computer science graduate with a master's degree from Ontario Tech University (formerly known as University of Ontario Institute of Technology). I'm passionate in creating applications that are interesting, practical and innovative. My biggest achievement is my master's thesis (Midair Handwriting in Virtual Reality) where I created a project that is three-fold. First was developing a data-gathering application using Unity and C\# where participants could write in midair while the application gathered data. Second was performing the data-gathering experiment. The third was performing data preprocessing (data cleaning, transformation, feature engineering) on the collected data to train and test several machine learning models. 

After graduating, I worked on a couple of full-stack development projects. Most recent is my [Electric Guitar Finder Website](https://github.com/kermattc/electric-guitar-backend)
